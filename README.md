# Coronavirus_CounterMeasures
A dataset describing coronavirus containment measures taken by governments worldwide

The dataset goes from 23 January 2020, when China announced the first lockdown measures in Wuhan, to today. Here's the methodology:

0. No or few containment measures in place.

1. Ban on public gatherings, cancellation of major events and conferences. It’s not always easy to know when a country goes from step 0 to step 1. I’ve used public announcements by the government and looked at major sporting and cultural events in the country and when they became cancelled.

2. Schools and universities closed. As from the first day of closure, not when the announcement is made.

3. Non-essential shops, restaurants and bars closed. As from the first day of closure, not when the announcement is made.

4. Full lockdown. Government requires citizens to shelter in place. In some cases, citizens are allowed to come out to buy essential items. In other cases, the curfew is more strict.

I have received lots of questions about the dataset. I’d like to make it open for collaboration, as I’m not sure I’ll be able to keep up on my own with all the government announcements around the world.
