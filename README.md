# Coronavirus_CounterMeasures
A dataset describing coronavirus containment measures taken by governments worldwide

--- Update from 26 March 2020 ---

The dataset goes from 23 January 2020, when China announced the first lockdown measures in Wuhan, to 28 March 2020. Here's the methodology:

0. No or few containment measures in place.

1. Ban on public gatherings, cancellation of major events and conferences. It’s not always easy to know when a country goes from step 0 to step 1. I’ve used public announcements by the government and looked at major sporting and cultural events in the country and when they became cancelled.

2. Schools and universities closed. As from the first day of closure, not when the announcement is made. Dates largely match those available from Unesco at the following web address: https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures

3. Non-essential shops, restaurants and bars closed. As from the first day of closure, not when the announcement is made.

4. Full lockdown. Government requires citizens to shelter in place. In most cases, citizens are allowed to come out to buy essential items. However, there are several degrees of severity not necessarily captured by this dataset. In some cases, curfews can be in place for part of the day or at night only. In others, they are all day long.

I have received lots of questions about the dataset. I’d like to make it open for collaboration, as I’m not sure I’ll be able to keep up on my own with all the government announcements around the world.
